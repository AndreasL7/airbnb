# Project Description

Welcome to the DBA3702 Descriptive Analytics with R GitHub repository. This repository contains all the materials, code, and documentation for our project focused on Descriptive Analytics using R. In this project, we address a critical problem in the short-term rental market, particularly with Airbnb, by providing solutions for prospective investors and existing landlords.

# Introduction and Motivation

### Background
The short-term rental market, driven by platforms like Airbnb, has seen exponential growth in recent years. Property owners now have the opportunity to rent out their units to a diverse range of guests. However, this decentralized and competitive market has posed challenges for investors and existing landlords.

### Problem Statement
Our project aims to tackle the following challenges:

1. For Prospective Airbnb Investors:
- Rental Yield Projection: Prospective investors struggle to project the rental yield of a property accurately. This uncertainty can lead to poor investment decisions due to the lack of information about expected rental income.

- Optimal Pricing: Investors are unsure about the optimal pricing strategy for their Airbnb rentals. The absence of competitor pricing data in their proximity makes it difficult to maximize rental income.

2. For Existing Airbnb Landlords:
- Pricing Optimization: Existing landlords face difficulty in making accurate pricing decisions. They often underprice or overprice their properties, leading to lost income or low tenancy rates.

- Competitor Analysis: There is a lack of tools that provide spatial competitor analysis for Airbnb landlords. They need a way to assess the competitive landscape based on property characteristics and location.
